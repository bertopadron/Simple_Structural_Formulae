* 28.10.24. version 0.28 New tab "Elemental input PerpleX  (wt.%)", so far only Fe2+ and Fe3+ implemented. Tested against two  spinels at two fO2.
* 18.03.25. version 0.29 the new tab above remaned as "Fe3+  from PerpleX (wt.%) O2", has been corrected for hydrous minerals such as  antigorite and assumes that iron is either as ferric or ferrous iron only  (does not take into account native iron or any redox element such as C and  S). Need to be tested against other phases and in carbonates. In general is a  system of equation with two unknows, so the redox state of all element but Fe  need to be constrained.
* 07.04.25. version 0.31 Wet chemistry error in S in different oxidation states corrected (courtesy SC). Options working for WR (mol/kg and anions only)
